 <strong>02-05-2024</strong> – <strong>Initial Dataset Discussion</strong>
 <br>
 - Talked about different datasets from GEO and TCGA
 - Review a selection of files filtered by clinical relevance, available multi-omics data, & adequate patient numbers
 - Summation of the selected list:
   - Itegrative Analysis in IBD: Utilizing blood DNA from 240 IBD cases and 191 controls, this study (GEO Series: GSE87650) employs DNA methylation, genomic, and gene expression data integration to understand IBD. It involves technical validation with whole-genome bisulfite   sequencing and cell-specific methylation analysis.
   - Gastrointestinal Cancer Plasma Multi-Omics: Investigates biomarkers using cfDNA and cfRNA from blood samples for gastrointestinal cancer (GEO Series: GSE186607, GSE186595, GSE186587, GSE186575), focusing on genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic alterations in colorectal cancer and stomach adenocarcinoma patients.
   - Epigenomic Plasticity in Prostate Cancer: This research (GEO Series: GSE197780, GSE197776, GSE197774) explores the epigenetic reprogramming of prostate cancer due to treatment with enzalutamide, integrating data from ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and CNV-seq to analyze the impact on tumor biology.
   - Alzheimer’s Disease Epigenetic Alterations: A study (GEO Series: GSE153875) utilizing a multi-omics approach to uncover epigenetic changes related to Alzheimer's, integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from post-mortem human brains, focusing on histone modifications.
   - Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Research (GEO Series: GSE149612, GSE149609) examines the epigenetic landscape of DNA methylation in ESCC, integrating WGS, WGBS, RNA-seq, and proteomic data to uncover epigenetic mechanisms driving the disease.
   - Metabolic Reprogramming in Colorectal Cancer: The study (GEO Series: GSE89076) investigates metabolic changes in CRC, utilizing metabolomics, gene sequencing, transcriptomics, and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify early-stage metabolic alterations.
   - Breast Cancer Multi-Omics Integration: A deep learning study (TCGA-BRCA) develops models for integrating gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and CNVs to predict breast cancer survival, highlighting feature-level integration using autoencoders.
